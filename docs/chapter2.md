# Part 2: Introduction to Testing & Writing Tests for Functions(30 min)

Summary of section: Introduction to py.test as a simple way to get off the ground with automated testing.

1. Using py.test at the command line in an empty project directory.
1. The assertion statement is your friend!
1. Warm-up example: write an `add()` function, write a test for correctness, write a counter-example.
1. More complex example: write a function that sums up two floating point numbers, and log10 transforms them. Write a test for correctness, write a counter-example.
1. More complex example: write a function that strips punctuation and spaces and special characters from text, and transforms it into a "bag of words". Write test for correctness and counter-example test.
