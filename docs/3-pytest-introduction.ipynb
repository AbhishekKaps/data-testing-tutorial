    "## `pytest` idioms\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I get you writing code, it's important to make sure that you know some of `pytest`'s idioms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, `pytest` expects that the block of code that you want to test is wrapped inside a function or a class. That way, you can import it into your testing suite (more on what the \"testing suite\" is later!). In other words, you should have a function defined in an importable module, and that module should be installed in the conda environment. (And if even this paragraph feels awkward to you, I'd recommend reading the \"Prerequisite Knowledge\" chapter again.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, `pytest` looks for all files that are prefixed with `test_` (for example, `test_something.py`), and then looks for all functions in those files that are also prefixed with `test_` (for example `def test_somefunc()`). Those will then comprise the \"test suite\" for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, `pytest` is invoked at the command line. A single basic command, with no configuration flags, looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "pytest .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells `pytest` to look recursively under the current working directory for all tests to execute, and then it will execute them in order."

My engineering colleagues will have confidence in taking over what I have developed, because they know they have an easy starting point for studying the code (in the test suite).\n",
