# Part 6: Property-based testing

Summary of section: introduction to `hypothesis`.

1. Property-based testing: we don't write fixed tests, but instead test the "properties" of a function (input data range, data type) for correctness.
1. How to use `hypothesis`: the decorators!
1. Finding boundary cases using `hypothesis`, and fixing functions (e.g. log10 transform function: add assertion statement in function to alert function user to potential errors ==> defensive programming!).
1. Write tests using `hypothesis` for checking the functions from Part 2.
